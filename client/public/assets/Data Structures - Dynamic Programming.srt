1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,911
Dynamic Programming solves problems efficiently by
remembering past results.

2
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:08,051
Consider calculating 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.

3
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:12,382
A computer might calculate this step-by-step.

4
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:19,383
Without memoization, each time it needs a sum, like 1+1, it
recalculates it from scratch.

5
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:25,469
Memoization stores results of expensive calls, returning cached
results for the same inputs.

6
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:31,018
For 1+1+1+1+1, after 1+1=2, it remembers '2'.

7
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:35,997
When 2+1 is needed, it uses the stored '2'.

8
00:00:35,997 --> 00:00:41,038
This trades a little memory to store results for a significant boost
in processing speed.

9
00:00:41,038 --> 00:00:47,752
This fundamental concept, trading memory for speed, is the essence of
Dynamic Programming.

10
00:00:47,752 --> 00:00:54,700
Understanding memoization optimizes algorithms, a crucial skill for
any developer or student.
