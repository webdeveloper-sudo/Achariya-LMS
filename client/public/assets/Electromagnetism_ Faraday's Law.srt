00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,617
Electromagnetism is a fundamental force.

2
00:00:02,617 --> 00:00:08,359
Faraday's Law of Induction explains how changing magnetic fields
create electric currents.

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:13,307
Consider a simple setup: a wire coil connected to a
meter and a bar magnet.

4
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:16,065
Stationary, the meter shows no current.

5
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:22,779
But move the magnet near or through the coil, and the meter registers
current with 'energy ripples' around the coil.

6
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:27,299
This is electromagnetic induction, core of Faraday's Law: changing

7
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:32,209
magnetic flux through a circuit induces
electromotive force, or voltage.

8
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:38,296
Not just a curiosity, it's the principle behind modern technologies
like wireless charging for devices.

9
00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:41,965
In wireless charging, the pad's transmitting coil creates a

10
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:46,785
fluctuating magnetic field, inducing current in the
device's receiving coil.

11
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:56,059
This energy transfer, thanks to Faraday's Law, powers devices without
physical connections, simplifying lives and advancing technology.

12
00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:03,582
From power generation to gadgets, Faraday's Law shapes our
technologically advanced world, enabling innovation.
